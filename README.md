Hello!

This my Zoomcamp project for the data engineering course. Instead of writing a readme file, I wrote an article that you can find here: https://arbenkqiku.github.io/create-end-to-end-kafka-streaming-pipeline. The dashboard that I created is here: https://lookerstudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/29293e59-6dac-4271-992d-b0e647551ed5/page/K78uD

Here is an overview of my project.
